The investigation will determine the technical merits and the effect on the charges, schedule, and other terms and conditions that may result from the implementation of the PCR. The parties will then decide either to accept or to reject the PCR; or reject the PCR. If the PCR is rejected, the rejecting party will inform the requesting party of the reason for the rejection. A mutually signed PCR will be deemed an amendment to this Agreement.

       " 'Service Levels IBM will provide the following monthly availability Service Level Agreement (“SLA”) for the Services provided by IBM: For Managed Devices and Managed Servers (including firewall(s) and switches) that are not clustered or configured in a high availability configuration, the SLA is a minimum of 99.7 percent. For Managed Devices and Managed Servers (including firewall(s) and switches) that are clustered or configured in a high availability configuration, the SLA is a minimum of 99.9 percent. For Managed Application Solution (including firewalls(s) and switches) that are clustered or configured in a high availability configuration, the SLA is a minimum of 98.0 percent. For Managed Application Solution (including firewalls(s) and switches) that is not clustered or configured in a high availability configuration, the SLA is a minimum of 99.5 percent. For Basic Monitoring Services the SLA is a minimum of 99.9 percent applicable only for the core infrastructure components (including power, cooling, Internet connectivity, firewalls, load balancers, SSL acceleration, Network Intrusion Detection, VLAN segments, switches, VPN connection at the Hosting Center, and all related connections). For Advanced Monitoring Services the SLA is a minimum of 99.9 percent applicable only for the core infrastructure components (including power, cooling, Internet connectivity, firewalls, load balancers, SSL acceleration, Network Intrusion Detection, VLAN segments, switches, VPN connection at the Hosting Center, and all related connections). Availability Credits If in any month during the term of Managed Hosting Services the Monthly Availability Percentage for a Qualifying Server is less than the SLA Target Percentage for that Qualifying Server, Customer shall be eligible to receive an Availability Credit, subject to Section 8.3(b), 8.4, 8.5, 8.6 and 8.7. If in any month during the term of Managed Hosting Services the Monthly Availability Percentage for Basic Monitoring or Advanced Monitoring Services is less than the SLA Target Percentage for Basic Monitoring or Advanced Monitoring Services, Customer shall be eligible to receive an Availability Credit, subject to Section 8.3(b), 8.4, 8.5, 8.6 and 8.7. Customer agrees to contact the IBM Help Desk to report problems and open trouble tickets that reflect the start time of the Outage event. Settlement of Credits Availability Credits will be aggregated on a quarterly basis and settled by the last day of the first month following the end of the quarter in which such Availability Credits were earned. (For example, the aggregate Availability Credits earned in the first quarter 2007 will be applied against Monthly Recurring Charge for Services the Customer incurs in the April 2007 invoice.) Any Availability Credits owed from IBM to Customer upon the expiration or termination of the Services will be paid within one (1) month following the effective date of expiration or termination. If the Monthly Recurring Charge for a subject month has not been incurred, or for any other reason has been credited or waived, Customer shall not be eligible for an Availability Credit for that month.  Customer shall receive no more than five percent (5%) of Customer’s Monthly Recurring Charge for Managed Hosting Services as an Availability Credit in a given month. Commencement of Service Level Agreement IBM will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to meet the SLA Target Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer shall not be eligible for an Availability Credit until the first full calendar month following the Hosting Service Ready Date. Exclusivity of Remedies Customer agrees that its sole remedy for IBM’s failure to meet an SLA Target Percentage is the Availability Credit as provided in this Attachment. Exclusions IBM is not responsible for any Outage outside of its control, including but not limited to, the following examples: periods of scheduled or emergency maintenance activities or scheduled Outage; Outage due to problems with Customer provided Content or programming errors including, but not limited to, Content installation and integration; ',\n",
